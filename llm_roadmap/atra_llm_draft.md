This extended OPM captures the essential components, relationships, and roles involved in the life cycle of Large Language Models.

### 4. Figures of Merit (FOM)

Key FOMs for LLMs include:

1. **Model Size (Parameters):**
   - **Units:** Count of parameters.
   - **Calculation:** Simply count the number of parameters in the model. For example, in a neural network, it would be the sum of the weights and biases in all layers.
   - **Additional Information:** Larger models often have more capacity for learning complex patterns but may also require more computational resources.

2. **Token Count:**
   - **Units:** Count of tokens.
   - **Calculation:** Sum the number of tokens in the input and output. Tokens can be words, subwords, or characters, depending on the model's architecture.
   - **Additional Information:** A higher token count generally indicates a larger language context that the model can understand and generate.

3. **Inference Speed:**
   - **Units:** Time per inference (e.g., seconds per inference).
   - **Calculation:** Measure the time it takes for the model to process an input and produce an output during inference.
   - **Additional Information:** Faster inference is crucial for real-time applications. It is influenced by hardware, model architecture, and optimization techniques.

4. **Training Cost:**
   - **Units:** Financial cost (e.g., dollars, euros).
   - **Calculation:** Sum of the costs associated with hardware, electricity, and human resources during the training process.
   - **Additional Information:** Training large models can be computationally expensive. Costs may include hardware infrastructure, electricity, and the salaries of the machine learning experts involved.

5. **Energy Efficiency:**
   - **Units:** Energy consumption per inference (e.g., joules per inference).
   - **Calculation:** Measure the energy consumed during inference and divide it by the number of inferences.
   - **Additional Information:** Energy-efficient models are important for sustainability. Improvements in hardware efficiency and model optimization contribute to energy efficiency.

6. **Bias Mitigation:**
   - **Units:** Effectiveness score (dimensionless).
   - **Calculation:** Evaluate the success of bias mitigation techniques using metrics such as fairness, balance, and representation.
   - **Additional Information:** Addressing biases in LLMs is critical for ethical and fair use. Techniques involve diverse training data, careful model design, and continuous monitoring.

7. **Inference Cost:**
   - **Units:** Financial cost per inference (e.g., dollars per inference).
   - **Calculation:** Divide the total cost of inference (including hardware, energy, and maintenance) by the number of inferences.
   - **Additional Information:** In some applications, especially those involving cloud services, the cost per inference is a critical factor. It considers both computational resources and energy usage during inference.

8. **Latency:**
   - **Units:** Time delay (e.g., milliseconds).
   - **Calculation:** Measure the time delay between submitting an input and receiving the corresponding output during inference.
   - **Additional Information:** Latency is crucial in real-time applications, and it's different from inference speed, as it includes network delays and other overhead.

9. **Robustness:**
   - **Units:** Robustness score (dimensionless).
   - **Calculation:** Assess the model's performance under different conditions, including adversarial attacks, noisy input, or variations in language use.
   - **Additional Information:** A robust model maintains performance across diverse scenarios, contributing to its reliability in real-world applications.

10. **Interpretability:**
    - **Units:** Interpretability score (dimensionless).
    - **Calculation:** Evaluate how easily humans can understand and interpret the model's decisions.
    - **Additional Information:** Interpretability is crucial for gaining insights into model behavior, ensuring trust, and identifying and addressing potential biases.

11. **Scalability:**
    - **Units:** Model performance as data size increases (dimensionless).
    - **Calculation:** Assess how well the model scales with an increase in the size of the input data.
    - **Additional Information:** Scalability is important for handling diverse and large datasets efficiently.

12. **Adaptability:**
    - **Units:** Adaptation score (dimensionless).
    - **Calculation:** Measure how well the model can adapt to new domains or changing data distributions.
    - **Additional Information:** Models that can adapt to evolving language use and new topics have extended utility over time.

13. **Perplexity:**

       - **Units:** Dimensionless.

       - **Calculation:** Perplexity is a measure of how well a probability distribution or probability model predicts a sample. For language models, perplexity is often used to evaluate how well the model predicts a sequence of words. It is calculated as the inverse probability of the test set, normalized by the number of words.

       - **Additional Information:** Lower perplexity values indicate better performance. Intuitively, perplexity can be thought of as a measure of uncertainty or surprise associated with a model's predictions.

14. **Elo Score for Language Models (LLMs):**

       - **Units:** Elo points.

       - **Calculation:** The Elo score for LLMs is determined through a competitive ranking system, similar to its application in chess. Models start with an initial Elo rating, and after each competition (e.g., in language generation tasks), their ratings are adjusted based on the outcome. If a model performs better than expected, its Elo rating increases, and vice versa. The adjustment is influenced by the Elo ratings of the competing models.

       - **Additional Information:** The Elo score provides a relative measure of a language model's performance compared to other models in a competitive setting. Higher Elo scores indicate better relative performance.


These  metrics provide a  comprehensive view of the capabilities, limitations, and practical considerations associated with large language models. The choice of which metrics to prioritize may depend on the specific use case and application requirements. Keep in mind that these figures of merit are interconnected, and optimizing one may have trade-offs with others. For instance, reducing model size may improve inference speed but might impact token count and potentially bias mitigation. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation is crucial for assessing the overall performance of large language models.

#### Evolution of Technology

In the ever-evolving landscape of LLMs, the pursuit of optimal model architectures has become a focal point in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The models are characterized by billions of parameters. However, the quest for efficiency and scalability has prompted researchers to investigate the impact of model size on performance, giving rise to a critical discussion on the figures of merit for LLMs.

The need to optimize the size of language models is underscored by a compelling trade-off between model scale and performance. Traditionally, larger models have demonstrated superior capabilities in capturing intricate linguistic nuances, resulting in state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances across standard tests. Nonetheless, the escalation in model size comes at the cost of computational resources, prompting a reevaluation of the efficiency of smaller-scale models.

![Perito LLM](./LLM_Pareto/llm_pareto_log.png)

An intriguing revelation surfaces when examining the performance of models based on their parameter count. A figure suggests that models with fewer than 1 billion parameters struggle to surpass a 30% performance threshold across standard tests. This apparent limitation highlights the challenge faced by smaller models in grasping the intricacies of language tasks, thereby emphasizing the crucial role played by model size in achieving proficiency.

Contrastingly, as model size expands to around 10 billion parameters, a significant leap in performance is observed. These mid-sized models can be fine-tuned to achieve commendable scores, approaching the 70% mark in standard tests. This achievement represents a substantial improvement over their smaller counterparts, positioning these models in close proximity to the current SOTA.

However, the pursuit of even greater performance gains suggests a diminishing returns scenario as model size approaches 100 billion parameters. The quest for marginal improvements becomes increasingly challenging, highlighting a plateau in performance gains beyond a certain scale. This observation underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of the figures of merit for LLMs, with an emphasis on striking an optimal balance between model size, computational efficiency, and performance.

In this context, our analysis of figures of merit serves to unravel the intricate relationship between LLM size and task proficiency. The performance landscape across diverse model scales indicates that there will be an impact of technological advancements and innovations, that will heighten the efficiency and transformation of the Pareto Front. This transformation is expected to usher in substantial improvements and novel directions in the field of language model research.

### 6. Positioning of Competing Companies and Products: FOM Charts

Benchmarking charts will compare various competing company's LLMs based on FOMs. These charts will help visualize the various companies positions in the market and identify areas for improvement or investment. 

The easiest metrics to compare are the elo and the cost of the model. 

**Elo Score for Language Models (LLMs):**

   - **Units:** Elo points.
   - **Calculation:** The Elo score for LLMs is determined through a competitive ranking system, similar to its application in chess. Models start with an initial Elo rating, and after each competition (e.g., in language generation tasks), their ratings are adjusted based on the outcome. If a model performs better than expected, its Elo rating increases, and vice versa. The adjustment is influenced by the Elo ratings of the competing models.
   - **Additional Information:** The Elo score provides a relative measure of a language model's performance compared to other models in a competitive setting. Higher Elo scores indicate better relative performance.

   **Comments:**
   - The Elo system offers a dynamic and adaptable framework for comparing language models in a competitive context, fostering continual improvement in the field.
   - The use of Elo scores allows for a direct comparison of different models, providing insights into their relative strengths and weaknesses.
   - Elo scores can be particularly useful in benchmarking tasks, competitions, or collaborative efforts where multiple language models are evaluated against each other.

   **Considerations:**
   - The Elo system requires a sufficient number of competitive events to establish meaningful ratings. Frequent model comparisons contribute to more accurate Elo scores.
   - Calibration is crucial; the initial Elo ratings and the update mechanism should be chosen thoughtfully to ensure fair and consistent evaluations across different competitions and datasets.

   **Overall Evaluation:**
   - The Elo score for LLMs serves as an effective figure of merit, fostering a competitive landscape that encourages continuous advancements in language model performance.
   - It provides a standardized and interpretable way to compare models, making it easier for researchers and practitioners to assess the progress of language models in a dynamic and evolving field.
   - While Elo scores offer valuable insights, they are most effective when used in conjunction with other metrics that capture specific aspects of language model performance, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of their capabilities.


**Perplexity:**
   - **Units:** Dimensionless.
   - **Calculation:** Perplexity is a measure of how well a probability distribution or probability model predicts a sample. For language models, perplexity is often used to evaluate how well the model predicts a sequence of words. It is calculated as the inverse probability of the test set, normalized by the number of words.
   - **Additional Information:** Lower perplexity values indicate better performance. Intuitively, perplexity can be thought of as a measure of uncertainty or surprise associated with a model's predictions.

   **Comments:**
   - Perplexity is a common metric for assessing the quality of language models, particularly in tasks like text generation and language modeling.
   - A lower perplexity suggests that the model is more certain and accurate in predicting the next word in a sequence. It reflects the ability of the model to capture the underlying patterns and structure of the language.
   - Perplexity is closely related to the concept of entropy. Models with lower perplexity can be seen as having lower entropy, meaning they provide more focused and accurate predictions.

   **Considerations:**
   - Perplexity is sensitive to the size and nature of the dataset. Models trained on larger and more diverse datasets often achieve lower perplexity values.
   - It is essential to consider task-specific requirements. While perplexity is a valuable measure for language modeling tasks, other tasks such as machine translation or summarization may benefit from additional or task-specific metrics.

   **Overall Evaluation:**
   - Perplexity serves as a valuable figure of merit for language models, offering insights into their ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate sequences of words.
   - When optimizing language models, practitioners often aim to minimize perplexity by adjusting model architecture, training data, or other hyperparameters.
   - Despite its utility, it's important to interpret perplexity in conjunction with other metrics and consider the specific application context to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of a language model's performance.

LLM Large Language Model Cost Analysis - La Javaness R&D

#### Introduction

The landscape of generative models is rapidly changing. The recent releases in LLM architecture models include the GPT-4 model from OpenAI and the open-source Llama2 from MetaAI.
For AI practitioners, one of the key factors beyond all criteria when choosing the right solution for their business is the cost of integrating LLM applications. There are two primary options for developing an LLM application:

- API Access Solution: Utilizing closed-source models such as the latest GPT-4 model from OpenAI via API access.
- On-Premises Solution: Building a model based on a pre-trained open-source model and hosting it within your own IT infrastructure.

In this article, we aim to address the following questions: What are the different components contributing to the cost of an LLM application, and how do they differ between each choice of approach? We will break down the cost into three parts as follows:

- Cost of Project Setup and Inference.
- Cost of Maintenance.
- Other Associated Costs.

Finally, we will present a hypothetical scenario based on one of our projects to compare the costs between API access solutions (such as ChatGPT) and open-source LLM.

#### Cost of initial set-up and inference

The cost of the initial setup includes the expenses associated with storing the model and making predictions for query requests.

**For the API access solution**
We have listed the three most commonly used providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Vertex AI, Anthropic) for an API access solution. Each provider has different pricing metrics, which depend on the specific use case (summarization, classification, embedding, etc.) and the chosen model. For each request, you are billed based on the total number of input tokens (cost for input) and generated output tokens (cost for output). In some use cases, you may also need to pay a price per request (cost per request). For example, the classification task with Cohere models costs $0.2 for every 1,000 classifications.

| Provider  | Model            | Cost for input         | Cost for output        | Cost per request         |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| OpenAI    | text-davinci-004 | $0.03/ 1K tokens       | $0.06/ 1K tokens       | 0                        |
| OpenAI    | text-davinci-003 | $0.02/ 1K tokens       | $0.02/ 1K tokens       | 0                        |
| OpenAI    | text-davinci-002 | $0.002/ 1K tokens      | $0.002/ 1K tokens      | 0                        |
| OpenAI    | gpt-3.5-turbo    | $0.002/ 1K tokens      | $0.002/ 1K tokens      | 0                        |
| OpenAI    | gpt-4-turbo      |                        |                        |                          |
| Cohere    | Default, Custom  | $0.015/ 1K tokens      | $0.015/ 1K tokens      | $0.2/ 1K classifications |
| Vertex AI | PaLM2 for text   | $0.0005/ 1K characters | $0.0005/ 1K characters | 0                        |
| Vertex AI | PaLM2 for chat   | $0.0005/ characters    | $0.0005/ characters    | 0                        |
| Anthropic | Claude-1         |                        |                        |                          |
| Anthropic | Claude-2         |                        |                        |                          |

**For the on-premise solution**
Hosting an open-source model can be challenging for your IT infrastructure due to the enormous size of model parameters. The cost of the initial setup primarily involves the expenses associated with establishing a suitable IT infrastructure to host the model.

| Provider                               | Model      | Number of parameters     |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| Meta with Microsoft                    | LLama 2    | 7B, 13B, 32B, 65.2B      |
| Meta                                   | LLama      | 7B, 13B, 70B             |
| Technology Innovation Institute of UAE | Flacon LLM | 7B, 40B                  |
| Stanford’s CRFM                        | Alpaca     | 7B                       |
| Google                                 | Plan-T5    | 80M, 250M, 780M, 3B, 11B |
| MPT                                    | MosaicML   | 7B, 30B                  |

As we can observe, the models can be categorized into two groups:

- Small-sized models that are suitable for running locally on your personal computers (~ 7B parameters).
- Large-sized models that require hosting on cloud servers such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or your internal GPU server.

Pricing in this context is determined by the hardware, and users are billed on an hourly basis. The cost varies, with the most affordable option being $0.6 per hour for a NVIDIA T4 (14GB) and the highest costing $45.0 per hour for 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs (640GB).

#### Cost of Maintenance

When the model’s performance decreases due to changes in data distribution, it becomes necessary to fine-tune your model using new customer datasets. Consequently, the cost of maintenance encompasses expenses related to labeling your training dataset, fine-tuning, and deploying a new model.

**For the API Access Solution**
Some providers, such as OpenAI and VertexAI, offer a fine-tuning service with their pricing that covers data upload, model training, and deployment of the newly trained model. Below is an example of a pricing matrix for ChatGPT by OpenAI and Vertex AI:

[needs to be added]



**For the on-premise solution**
The cost of fine-tuning open-source models primarily consists of expenses related to running the IT infrastructure for retraining a Language Model (LM). The cost you incur is directly proportional to the duration for which you rent the server to fine-tune the model. The necessary time to complete the fine-tuning can be estimated based on the complexity of the task, such as the size of your pre-trained model (number of model parameters), the size of the training dataset (number of tokens), and the training procedure (number of batches, number of epochs). The more complex the task, the longer it will take.

For example, fine-tuning the smaller model Falcon 7B may require a machine with at least twice the memory capacity (approximately 16GB). For a training dataset containing several thousand tokens, it can take about a day to complete the fine-tuning. The total cost can be calculated as follows:

Total Cost = Hourly cost of the rented instance x Number of hours required for training the model.

#### Other Considerations

Additional costs to consider include environmental factors such as CO2 emissions and human resources.

##### **CO2 Emissions**

AI model sizes are doubling every 3.4 months, leading to a more significant environmental footprint for deep-learning models due to their increasing size. In one study, it was estimated that OpenAI’s GPT-3 emits more than 500 metric tons of CO2 during training:

Comparison of carbon emissions during the training of LLMs for various models (Source: ‘Reducing the Carbon Footprint of Generative AI’ by Boris Gamazaychikov)
As we can see, the carbon emission cost for training LLMs is generally high. However, it can be amortized through a large scale of use and the replacement of economic activities by LLMs.
When it comes to using LLMs for inference or retraining, AI practitioners need to carefully choose an adaptive IT infrastructure to reduce the CO2 cost. Several important factors determine the level of 

##### CO2 impact when using an IT infrastructure

**Compute:** This is the number of FLOPs (floating point operations per second) needed to complete a task. It depends on model parameters and data size. Some studies show that a larger model doesn’t always result in better performance. You can choose a model that fits your use case well by striking a balance between model size and performance.

**Data Center Location and Efficiency:** Each data center is powered by local energy production, so CO2 emissions and energy efficiency vary based on the data center’s location.
Hardware: Different computing processors (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs) have varying energy efficiencies for specific tasks.

In real-life situations, we can estimate the impact of CO2 emissions directly through the overall energy or resource consumption by the IT infrastructure hosting the LLM applications. One useful tool for tracking CO2 consumption is CodeCarbon.io .

**Expertise**
Another critical resource to pay attention to is the human factor. How well the team can acquire the new knowledge and skills required to maintain the service is vital. In this regard, open-source solutions tend to be more costly because they require a specialized staff to train and maintain LLM models. Conversely, for API access solutions, these tasks can be handled by the provider’s engineering team.

#### Cost Comparison between ChatGPT and Open-Source LLM

As discussed in the previous sections, the cost of implementing an LLM project varies depending on the chosen solution and the specific task. In this section, we aim to provide an estimation of costs based on the configuration of one of our projects.

Let’s consider that we want to build an API for a chatbot application powered by LLM technology. Assume that, on average, we have 50 chat discussions per day, with each discussion containing about 1000 words, including both the questions and answers.

Therefore, the total number of tokens used per day is calculated as 1000 x 50 x 3/4 = 37,500 tokens per day (we assume that one token is equivalent to about 3/4 of a word for the English language). The cost for using GPT-3.5 at a rate of $0.02 per token is $0.75 per day or 270$ per year.
If the request volume were to escalate to X times its current level, the cost would also increase linearly to X times. For instance, based on the rule of thumb, if the number of chats inscreased to 500 chats/ day the annual cost would increase to 2,7$ and for 5K chats per day, the annual cost would inscrease to 27K$.

On the other hand, for an on-premise solution, if the number of requests increases, we need to allocate a larger IT infrastructure to ensure optimal latency. However, the augmentation is certainly less than a linear augmentation for an API solution.
Consequently, there is a usage threshold at which ChatGPT is more cost-effective than utilizing open-source LLMs deployed to AWS when the number of requests is not high and remains below the break-even point. Indeed, the property of cost scaling with usage can also apply to the cost of maintenance, specifically fine-tuning, when dealing with very large dataset sizes.

#### Final Thoughts

In this post, we discussed the key differences between two approaches: 3rd-party solutions vs. open-source solutions, and how to estimate the total cost using an example project. Third party solution offers convenience and scalability but may result in higher expenses for inference. On the other hand, on-premises deployment provides greater control over data privacy but demands meticulous infrastructure and resource management.

The cost structure in this field could undergo rapid changes in the near future. It’s important to note that the estimations are rough, as there can be additional factors when running the entire pipeline in real-life scenario. To obtain more accurate insights, it is advisable to conduct benchmark projects, such as Proof of Concept (POC) projects, to estimate the average cost of the entire project pipeline.
Certain techniques can be applied to reduce costs, especially for strategies that tend to become expensive when dealing with large collections of queries and texts.

FrugalGPT: this technique has the capability to significantly reduce inference costs, up to 98%, while outperforming even the best individual LLMs (like GPT-4). There are three main strategies:
Prompt Adaptation: This strategy explores ways to identify effective, often shorter prompts to reduce costs.

LLM Approximation: It aims to create simpler and more cost-effective LLMs that can match the performance of powerful yet expensive LLMs on specific tasks.
LLM Cascade: This strategy focuses on adaptively choosing which LLM APIs to use for different queries.

Quantized Model: relates to techniques for reducing the precision of model weights, which can significantly decrease memory and computational demands during the inference stage.
